# onshape-sdk-lite

A minimal TypeScript/Node.js SDK for interacting with the Onshape REST API.

This package provides lightweight utilities for working with Onshape documents, parts, and assemblies using API keys or OAuth. It is designed for engineers and developers who need quick access to essential Onshape API features - without the complexity of the full Onshape SDK.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **limited version** - it will be updated regularly. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
